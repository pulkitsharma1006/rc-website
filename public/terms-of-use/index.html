            <p class="mb-4">Bad refund policies are infuriating. You feel like the company is just trying to rip you
                off. We never want our customers to feel that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you're ever
                unhappy with Roadcast, for any reason, just <a href="mailto:contactus@roadcast.in" class="text-[#14a99c] underline">contact our
                    support</a> team and we'll take care of you.</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal logistics ml-8 mb-12">
                <li class="mb-2">The Service is offered with a free trial for 7 days. If you need more than 7 days, you
                    will only be able to continue using the Service by paying in advance for additional usage. If you
                    fail to pay for additional usage, your account will be frozen and inaccessible until payment is
                    made.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, will result in the new rate being charged
                    at the next billing cycle. There will be no prorating for downgrades in between billing cycles.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account.
                    The Company does not accept any liability for such loss.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities,
                    and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United
                    States (federal or state) taxes. Where required, The Company will collect those taxes on behalf of
                    taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.</li>
                <li>Refunds are processed according to our Refund Policy.</li>

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Examples of partial refunds or credits we'd grant.</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal logistics ml-8 mb-12">
                <li class="mb-2">If you forgot to cancel Roadcast a year ago, and there's been activity on your account
                    since then, we'll review your account usage and figure out a partial refund based on how many months
                    you used it.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">If you upgraded your account a few months ago to a higher plan, but you didn't end up
                    using the extra features, projects, or storage space, although you did keep using Roadcast in
                    general, we'd consider applying a prorated credit towards future months.</li>
                <li>If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed
                    customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we'd issue a partial credit to your
                    account.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Get in touch</p>
            <p class="mb-12">At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a case-by-case basis.
                <a href="mailto:contactus@roadcast.in" class="text-[#14a99c] underline">Send us a note</a>, tell us what's up, and we'll work with you to make sure you're happy.</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal logistics ml-8 mb-12">
                <li class="mb-2">You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone
                    request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any
                    time by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The
                    Account screen provides a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link.</li>

                    cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be permanently deleted from backups and logs. This
                    information can not be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your
                    cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. But there will not be
                    any prorating of unused time in the last billing cycle.</li>
                <li>The Company, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account
                    and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time. Such
